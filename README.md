# how2nvim

This repo is aimed at new neovim users or vim users who want to migrate their configuration to lua but are unsure on how to do so. I want to provide a basic neovim setup that should be able to get you coding without much bloat while also _teaching_ you how the setup works and how you can extend it if you want to. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/AlphaKeks/how2nvim/issues) and I will look into it!

To get started, have a look at [the first part](./01-Introduction/README.md).

I might add more parts to the guide in the future depending on whether I get new ideas or suggestions.
